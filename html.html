                        Owls are magnificent birds of the Strigiformes order, all connected with peculiar traits.
                        They are usually solitary and nocturnal, with large eyes that tend to glow at night.
                        There are many superstitions and myths surrounding these birds, causing some unneeded apprehension and even fear.
                        However, these myths are unfounded.

                        parrot, term applied to a large group of gaudy, raucous birds of the family Psittacidae.
                Parrot also is used in reference to any member of a larger bird group, order Psittaciformes, which includes
                cockatoos (family Cacatuidae) as well. Parrots have been kept as cage birds since ancient times, and they 
                have always been popular because they are amusing, intelligent, and often affectionate.
                Several are astonishingly imitative of many sounds, including human speech.

                        Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often 
                brightly coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises
                the superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea (all others). The oldest butterfly 
                fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, though they likely originated in the Late 
                Cretaceous, about 101 million years ago.

                        Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle, bald eagle, and other birds of prey in the family Accipitridae. 
                Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. True eagles comprise the genus Aquila. 
                Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa.Outside this area, just 14 species can be foundâ€”two in 
                North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia
